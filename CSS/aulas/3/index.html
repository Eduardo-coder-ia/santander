      writing about vaporwave in 2016 is almost impossible. Neophytes often seem
      baffled by the genre, assuming they've heard of it at all. Meanwhile, fans
      insist that vaporwave is dead. How do you write about music that most
      people have never heard of and that fans claim doesn't exist any more? Or
      just as important: why? I think the continued relevance of the genre is
      explained in the history of vaporwave itself. Vaporwave arose in reaction
      to huge economic and social forces that are still very much a part of our
      lives: globalization, runaway consumerism, and manufactured nostalgia
      chief among them. There is no other kind of music that explicitly concerns
      itself with these aspects of our zeitgeist. And if vaporwave still maters,
      it's because those things do also.

      If you've never heard of vaporwave, the slowdown, remixed, and
      appropriative music genre defined at least in part by an obsession with
      '80s and '90s consumer culture—the first genre to be born and live its
      life entirely on the Internet—that's certainly OK. In fact, it's sort of
      the point. Vaporwave, itself a kind of musical parody of pop
      consciousness, never strived for mass appeal. It doesn't need our
      validation. That's true for any artifact of counterculture: mass
      acceptance would weaken its claim to authenticity. Forcing it into a form
      fit for mass appeal would dilute its identity. For an historical example,
      think of the music critic Lester Bangs' quote about how the '60s died as
      soon as it was OK to have long hair in the Midwest. That's why
      signal-boosting vaporwave might seem gauche to some fans and creators.
      Purveyors of a genre so rarified were almost obligated to bury it alive,
      to announce its death publicly before its actual time. It seems almost
      prudent to end the project while the relatively small groups of people
      passionate about vaporwave are still able to police the borders of the
      genre's identity. But the reasons for vaporwave being created in the first
      place are still very much relevant: cycnicsm about capitalism, sarcastic
      takes on the unachieved utopias of previous decades, consumerism,
      escapism, globalization, etc. Vaporwave's vision isn't exhausted yet,
      which keeps it fresh, pertinent, and growing in the form of fractured
      subgenres like "future funk" and "mall soft". So vaporwave is dead. Long
      live vaporwave.
